    <p><strong>The Unexpected Guest</strong></p>
    <p>
      It was a rainy Friday evening. Emma had just kicked off her shoes, ready to binge-watch her favorite series and enjoy some popcorn. 
      The week had been long, and all she wanted was peace and quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as she grabbed a blanket and settled on the couch, there was a knock at the door.
      "Who could that be?" she mumbled, a bit annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opening the door, she saw a man standing there, completely soaked. His umbrella had flipped inside out, and he looked lost.
      "Hi, I‚Äôm really sorry to bother you," he said. "My car broke down a few blocks from here, and my phone died. Could I use yours to call for help?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma hesitated. She wasn‚Äôt the type to let strangers in‚Äîbut the guy looked harmless‚Ä¶ and completely miserable.
      "Uh, sure. Just‚Ä¶ wait here a sec," she said, cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      She grabbed her old phone and handed it to him through the door. He made a quick call, thanked her, and turned to leave‚Äîbut slipped on the wet steps.
