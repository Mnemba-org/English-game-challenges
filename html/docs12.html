  <h3>📘 Quick Class: Tense Identification</h3>
  <p>
    In this challenge, you will read a sentence and identify which <strong>tense</strong> is being used. Tenses tell us <em>when</em> an action happens — in the past, present, or future.
  </p>

  <strong>Examples:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><em>She is watching TV.</em> ➡️ <strong>Present Continuous</strong> ✅</li>
    <li><em>They had eaten lunch before 2 PM.</em> ➡️ <strong>Past Perfect</strong> ✅</li>
    <li><em>I will travel next week.</em> ➡️ <strong>Simple Future</strong> ✅</li>
    <li><em>He goes to school every day.</em> ➡️ <strong>Simple Present</strong> ✅</li>
    <li><em>We were playing football.</em> ➡️ <strong>Past Continuous</strong> ✅</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Check the verb forms: <code>is/are + -ing</code> often means Present Continuous.</li>
    <li>Words like <em>yesterday</em>, <em>already</em>, <em>will</em> help you spot the tense.</li>
    <li>Perfect tenses often use <code>have/has/had + past participle</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>⏱️ Time Challenge:</strong> You will have <strong>15 seconds</strong> to identify the tense for each sentence. Speed + Accuracy = Success!</p>
